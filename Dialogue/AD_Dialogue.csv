the schools of magic	The six schools of magic are Alteration, Destruction, Illusion, Mysticism, Restoration, and Thaumaturgy.	Alteration,Destruction,Illusion,Mysticism,Restoration,Thaumaturgy	Building Name	==	the Mages Guild	NoLore	==	2			
Alteration	Spells of Alteration change the world around the caster so normal physical truths no longer hold.|Alteration concerns itself with magicka's ability to change, often radically, the structure and composition of any object. Unlike the school of Illusion, Alteration deals with actual change, not the appearance of it.|Slowfalling and Shield are two classic spells of the school of Alteration.|It is easy to confuse Illusion and Alteration. Both schools of magic attempt to create what is not there. The difference is in the rules of nature. Illusion is not bound by them, while Alteration is. This may seem to indicate that Alteration is the weaker of the two, but this is not true. Alteration creates a reality that is recognized by everyone. Illusion's reality is only in the mind of the caster and the target.		Building Name	==	the Mages Guild	NoLore	==	2			
Destruction	The school of Destruction is concerned with dealing damage to all forms of matter, both living and non-living, and with making matter more vulnerable to such damage. Mastery of Destruction magic involves a certain amount of danger.|The school of Destruction is concerned with the purely destructive capabilities of magicka, evident in spells like Fireball and Ice Storm.		Building Name	==	the Mages Guild	NoLore	==	2			
Illusion	Illusion spells can change a target's visibility, or produce or remove light.|The school of Illusion works with magicka in its capacity to camouflage, illuminate, or obscure without changing an object's structure.|Invisibility and Light are two of the most basic spells of Illusion.		Building Name	==	the Mages Guild	NoLore	==	2			
Mysticism	"The art of Mysticism allows a mage to alter the nature of magic itself and involves the manipulation of magical forces and boundaries to bypass the structures and limitations of the physical world.|The school of Mysticism experiments with the most arcane aspects of magicka. Its practitioners have expanded arcane “accidents"" into a useful if eclectic range of spells.|Because the forces being manipulated by Mysticism are dangerous and unknown, the spell effects are purposefully specific. This is evident in spells like Far Silence and Soul Trap."		Building Name	==	the Mages Guild	NoLore	==	2			
Restoration	Restoration spells heal, restore, and fortify the body's attributes and abilities, cure disease, and protect it from other malign influences.|The primary spells of the school of Restoration heal wounds, cure disease, and restore lost vitality. They can also augment strength, endurance, intelligence, agility, and other bodily attributes.|The school of Restoration is devoted to the salubrious and soothing powers of magicka, evident in spells like Cure Poison and Troll's Blood.		Building Name	==	the Mages Guild	NoLore	==	2			
Thaumaturgy	Thaumaturges can perform acts which can only be achieved through brute force in other schools of magic, such as levitation (which is said to involve the personal rejection of gravity), etherealness, detection, pacification, water walking, teleportation, summoning and the manipulation of other magical forces.|The school of Thaumaturgy concentrates on exposing or manipulating known forces and objects within their natural laws.

doth nuzzle with his sow… I am free, my love, art thou?… Swear not, my love, a sacred vow… Strange, I want to be with thou.|All follow this, and come to dust… Her face was fair and round her bust… No law against love can be just… If thou likes, thou may call it lust… I despair about doing what I must… The sword in the scabbard doth rust… There is no love where there is no trust… To the bright sky winged birds do thrust… Perhaps my song fills thee with disgust… To be strong, my love, thou must adjust… See thee that knight, strong and robust?… Fill me with a wanderlust|The while I think on thee, dear friend… The beginning comes closest to the end… The river is deepest at its widest bend… Neither borrow, love, nor lend!… Love of body and soul do blend… With pain, I feel my heart doth mend… The fool this ballad sour hath penned… Nights of bliss with thee I spend… To thee, all my cares I send… The past uncouth, the future unkenned… Your honor, know thee I will defend… This passion I feel should not offend… To Oblivion, my spirit doth… descend I fear, my love, thou doth condescend… The villian the knight shall apprehend… Love, can this thou comprehend?… On thy kind heart, I shall depend… O'er proud %cn, the stars suspend… My finest garments shall I rend|Lilies that fester smell worse than weed… I starve though from thy hand I feed… O Mara, thy cruel law I must heed… Follow, dear, the path I lead… From the blade of lust my soul doth bleed… To thee, fair Mara, thy mercy I plead… Eat good food and drink fine mead… Thou may find thou gets what thou need… Come water of Rains Hand, come with speed… Thou noblest specie, thou finest breed… Love is my religion, but sorrow my creed… Take me as thine, for love not for greed… Rain is aplenty in the month of First Seed… Strong like an ox, and swift as a steed… Your pride I swear I would never mislead… Foul laws of men doth true love impede… Your beauty and grace none can exceed|By Mara, I think my love rare… Flying like strong falcons high in the air… Like truth, I would see thy body bare… I kiss your lips and your neck so fair… Love makes us reckless, without care… Such boldness of passion do I dare… And how, my love, doth thou fare?… Sunshine in Mid Year shines your hair… He was her stallion, she his mare… Together, they walk down to the square… You never have seen a prettier pair!… O goddess Mara, acknowledge my prayer!… Bathed in sunlight, sunlight to wear… On moonlight and stars, lovers do swear… My love to thee I do sadly declare… To a spring dawn, I would not compare… My life is in agony, I am filled with despair… I remember that melancholy affair… My darling love, let the buyer beware|Reach with thy white hands out to me… Where jealousy walks, there sorrow be… I hold the locket, and thou hast the key… On thy bonny hair, I spy a flea… When thou seest love, do not flee… My goddess, O Mara, I do plea… What does it mean to be truly free?… Add one to us, love, and make three… Birds chatter love songs in their tree… But you, my love, are far across the sea… You give yourself and I give myself to thee… So it was stated by Mara's decree… No fool doth love ever guarantee… What a sight my eyes do see!… You drowned within the raging sea… I brought your soul inside of me|I got me flowers to strew thy way… Thy hair night-black, thy eyes bright as day… With a nonny, nonny, nonny, nonny, hey!… On a bough of flowers, my body lay… Like children, in gold fields we play… What price for love we fools do pay!… Like clouds fore the storm, I turn gray… My darling, beside me please stay!… My love like a strong branch ne'er will sway… Flowers you pluck to make your bouquet… The dancers begin their sad ballet… Now let us sport while we may… My love, thou art so far far away… A thousand wasted hours every day… Would thou simply throw me away?|Sweet day, so cool, so calm and bright… Shelter yourself from jealousy's bite… Peace, my love, I weary of the fight… Let us hold our love up to the light… Harvests come of plenty and blight… Pity not me my sorrowful plight!… Struggle we do with all our might… She was his lady and he her knight… Walketh thou in beauty like the night… Thou paineth me of jealous spite… I curse my eyes for their sight… I spy in the field a horse so white… Come my love, come at twilight… Of thee, dear, I do delight… I am in the room without a light… I would give anything to hold you tight… I would love to take you home tonight… Take me in your arms this very night|Thus sang the uncouth swain… Thy love is like a sweet, sweet bane… If this be love, I cannot feign… Bring me the knife that I be slain… Why must love bring so much pain?… In my heart a tyrant doth reign… Thou left me standing in the rain… How, my love, can thou be vain?… The fickle moon doth wax and wane… My heart is broke again in twain… Forces occult, daedric, arcane… With words, I to you enchain… You look to me with true disdain… How can I pray hope regain?… Perhaps, my love, I should explain… How do lovers from love abstain?… Thou came to me like a hurricane… I can see through thy legerdemain… I am plagued with thoughts inane… I only hope I might entertain…

a song	Fowls in the wood… I would if I could… O, that would be good… Let us do as we should… Would you, would you, would?… Does your sword so drip with blood?… Like a babe in the wood… I saw thee in my neighborhood… Knock, knock, knock on wood… Love, why cannot I be good?… The stem, petals, and bud|Just one face in the crowd… I pick thee out of the crowd… Sing it now, sing it loud!… Why must thou cry out loud?… My love, my love, be not proud… My love, I fear, is very proud… Lay upon my grave a shroud… The clouds look like a gray shroud… Praps I am somewhat over-endowed|He remembered her from his boyhood… Such innocence is left in childhood… My love, that is but a falsehood… Eat, love, of ivy and monkshood… Much more my love hath withstood… Your words to me are wormwood… Far more than that I understood… Am I now better understood?… Why must I be misunderstood?… Perhaps, dear, I misunderstood|When the green leaves were a-falling… My love will come a-calling… That is what I find most galling… Upon its knees, it comes a-crawling… The house with tenements a-sprawling… Conditions that I find appalling… You I always find enthralling… Then from the clouds am I ever falling… With tongue a-wagging and a-lolling|With a down, derry, derry, down, down… She wore a lovely, lovely gown… Nothing more than Jephre's clown… Her eyes were blue, her cheek so brown… Diamonds sparkled in his crown… Down in the sea we all drown… Smile, my love! Don't you frown!… Across bonny dell, across bonny town… Fly, fly away, and do never look down|O where have you been?… The knives edge is keen… Let me sharpen my skean… Ah, to me don't be mean… Thy black heart be clean… I'm thy king, be my queen… Spring, spring, so lovely green… What a remarkable scene!… O, she likes to be seen… I'm the knight to thy queen… I'll be Johnny, you be Jean… To your Johnny, I'll be Jean|He was a brave gallant… They all rave and rant… So sure, so calm and confidant… Be not, my friend, a sycophant!… Come, my love, lets gallivant!… An actor filled with his talent… They say thou art elegant… Love will grow like an ivy plant… No giant, but ever be an ant… Every nephew, niece, uncle, aunt|I'm sick, and very, very sick… Give the old dog a merry kick… The mother hen and her chick… Let me lick where bees doth lick… The rain doth make the road slick… Which shall I pick?… All of us, the dead and the quick… My house is built brick by brick… Is this all a merry trick?… My waist is a-growing thick… She a High Elf, He Nordic… Show me how you do that trick… Throw your arms around my neck… Cannot thou see what a merry wreck… So doth my blade go snacker snick|It was at Mid Year time… Up the tree, my dear, lets climb… Lizards crawling from the slime… Excuse my crude rude rhyme… To love is naught but a crime… White hands in blackest grime… To die, alas, in ones prime… Could it be more sublime?… Explain to me love's paradigm… Nature shows us pantomime… To touch the sky one more time… O Akatosh, give me more time|Bring water from the well… Ding, dong, dell… Over mountain, over dell… The fragrance I do smell… A mad wizard's spell… My love you do quell… A felon in his lonely cell… Fair love, love to sell… Upon the beach, I find a shell… My tale I try to tell… Where e'er my love doth dwell?… The tide it ebbs, the tide doth swell… Let me cry with a mighty yell… Against it, let us all rebel… My love doth this repel… But never would I thee compel… I bid thee then a fond farewell… Dong, Dong, Dell… Ding, Ding, Dell… Spring, Sprong, Sprell… I scream, I shout, I squeal, I yell… Like an angel, she fell… She lay like in a deathless spell… Stendarr, save me from this hell!… Like the Empress Kyntara in her cell… Farewell, to love, to life, farewell|The ways of love be foul… Upon the tree was a wise owl… Around her face she wore a cowl… The wolf at the far moon doth howl… At night, the daedra dark doth prowl… Into the wind, must I howl?… Arkay, grant me death here and now|It was a lover and his lass… They cluster in a murky mass… Forgive my song so bold and crass… She loved him not, alas, alas!… The gold the miser doth amass… A symbol bold on his cuirass… Drink spiced wine and hippocras… To thee, let me raise my glass… In a wildy mountain pass… Eyes as green as springtime grass… But, love, see thou the hourglass?|Blow, blow, thou winter breeze… A laborer finally at his ease… Milk doth rot to finest cheese… Her love she wished to please… Sweet juice from berry squeezed… My heart to love's hot fire freeze… Let this that blessed moment seize!… My love cajoles, my love doth tease… The Gods we are careful to appease… Sing me again love's sweet reprise… Alas, my heart has love's disease!… More tempting than Dibella's knees|O, where doth thou roam?… See Sentinel's stately pleasure dome?… The sea doth spray and foam… When will thou come home?… Work me hardier than a gnome… Mara wrote love's sacred tome… If you want, around the world roam… A house that is not a home|Then come and kiss me, twenty and sweet… There is nothing I can eat… Rat-rat-rat, the drums doth beat… If it's all a game, my love, let's cheat… Let me warm me with all thy heat… In the valley, hear the sheep sad bleat… O Notorgo, make my message fleet… Heart cold as Morning Star Skyrim sleet… Let us feast on wine and fruit and meat!… Arkay, cruel fate thee must mete… The twinkling stars, love, let us greet… Shall I see thee in a %cn street?… Thy hair, lush and brown, like Breton wheat… She is strong and he effete… The naughty night the dawn doth defeat… Elect me to the guards elite… My sweetest love, must I repeat?… Against such odds, dare we compete?… Don't ask me, love, to be discreet… From such a sight I can't retreat… Love me dear, she doth entreat… But lovers heart brim with deceit… Is not such science made obsolete?… I kiss you from your head to your feet|Merrily, merrily shall I live now… She shall curtsey and he shall bow… O'er the stream, lush flowerful bough… In the fields, the slave doth plough… Furrow not, my love, thy brow… The hog doth nuzzle with his sow… I am free, my love, art thou?… Swear not, my love, a sacred vow… Strange, I want to be with thou.|All follow this, and come to dust… Her face was fair and round her bust… No

fool this ballad sour hath penned… Nights of bliss with thee I spend… To thee, all my cares I send… The past uncouth, the future unkenned… Your honor, know thee I will defend… This passion I feel
